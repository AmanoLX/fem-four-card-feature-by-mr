## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

How to use different pseudo-classes to add the correct border-color for every card but also to implement a grid area and set the grid items to their correct position. A simple fade-in animation used on the feature cards.

### Continued development

Continue implementing pseudo-classes and more animations.
